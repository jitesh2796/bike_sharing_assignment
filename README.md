## General Information
- BoomBikes is aspiring to understand the demand of shared bikes among the people and the factors driving it to drive revenue
- The dataset consists of daily demand of shared bikes for two years and different factors like season, weather condition, temperature etc.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Built a linear regression model that can very well predict the demand of shared bike and explain over 80% variance in the target
- The final model consists of top 15 features to describe the demand
- Atemp, weathersit and a combination of year and season are some of the most important feaures in the model
